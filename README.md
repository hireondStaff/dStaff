dStaff
Lite Paper

With the rise of direct contract, freelance, and polywork more individuals are venturing into sole entrepreneurship. These roles are defined by being compensated with time for cash, so time spent managing your business is a drag on your potential revenue. Whether clients agree to retained, hourly or project-defined work all contract is defined by this exchange. 

Your Virtual Back Office
dStaff is a virtual assistant; managed automated workflows that handle the non revenue driving aspects of owning your business. We‚Äôve found that there are (3) three high impact points of contact for all sole entrepreneurs that are simplified using automated workflows and on-chain assets building immutable, public proof of reputation. By simplifying these three points (Hire, Deliver, Paid) we eliminate client management for the business owner, allowing them to focus on delivering revenue driving results for their clients. 

Hire
Utilizing webforms client and contractor create simple, fillable scope of work documentation available through templates or customized legal documents. When both parties e-sign the scope of work a pair of linked, transformable NFTs are minted and shared to both wallets. This signifies the public start of a business relationship. The scope of work is linked to the NFT but is available only through our off-chain web app. 

Deliver
Determined by the scope of work contractors will provide routine, prompted deliveries of ‚ÄúProof of Work‚Äù through the dStaff web app. When accepted by the client an on-chain NFT is minted signifying the continuation of the business relationship. These NFTs offer the opportunity to highlight a graphical representation of work and are linked to an invoice. 

Over time the volume of Deliver NFTs will transform the initial HIRE NFTs, symbolizing increased value and strength of the relationship. 

Paid
Partnering with reputable payment processor Stripe our system automates payment, accounts receivables and even implementing fees to ensure that invoices are paid securely while minimizing risk to either party. When payment is completed the Deliver NFTs are ‚Äúburned‚Äù building reputation for both client and contractors. 



Proof of Reputation
Contractors can feel like they are stuck in a David v. Goliath battle, regardless of the size of their audience or social status. For contractors, this is why platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr exist, to (allegedly) protect and uphold the relationship between client and contractor. This basic need for verification and protection is why the above platforms have carved out a massive percentage of wage theft up to 30% of industry costs (plus platform fees). 


Managed reputation and ensuring good faith agreements isn‚Äôt proprietary to hiring marketplaces; in fact, it‚Äôs downright common. The answer is simple. Build in public. Through minting, we create permissioned ‚ÄúProof of‚Äù documentation for key moments of work (Hire, Deliver, Paid) that provide public security around reputation and protection for payments. To put it simply, at dStaff we‚Äôre in the business of building your ‚ÄúProof of Reputation‚Äù automatically, by helping you automate and manage your non-revenue driving business tasks. 

Simple Experiences Leveraging Blockchain Solutions
Our web-based platform provides automation of repeatable business tasks for contractors and clients, designed to simplify work relationships while building trust and reputation between parties. Leveraging blockchain assets, namely custodial wallets (not for financial use) and dynamic NFT‚Äôs we deliver the advantage of public, open-source blockchains without the high experience cost of managing web3. 

Permissioned, Managed
Nothing means anything unless both parties agree. Using a custodial wallet system we manage the delivery of approved NFTs to create a mutual, permissioned relationship. Our proprietary on/off-chain solution allows for the discretion of private information with managed visibility of key, quantitative metrics: 
# of verified relationships
duration of time
volume of delivery 

As a public on-chain asset that you own within your wallet, you have the ability to integrate this verified digital asset within portfolios, job listing boards, resume/cv,, and Linkedin through our open API and partnerships. 


NonTransferable
Worried about scams, rug pulls, and other common misuses of blockchain technology? So are we. That's why dStaff NFTs are minted by us and delivered to your custodial dStaff wallet. As a non-transferable digital asset, they will remain there with reputation only tied to the two wallet addresses of client and contractor. 

All Things Will Pass
Each relationship ends, mutually or otherwise. Our system looks out for both parties by identifying and working to close open deliveries, payment requests, and hires in pre-determined time intervals. When it is determined, either by mutually permissioned request, single party request without response or complete lack of responses the initial hire NFT will close. Future work will need to be determined by the new scope of work (which is a great thing, as all relationships change, mature, and are dynamic) or will simply end. 

There are no feedback loops, and no public or private evaluation of work. We‚Äôre in the business of creating quantitative proof of reputation, not a qualitative evaluation of skill. 

That‚Äôs so Common
Yeah, what we do isn‚Äôt unique. Nor are we some righteous power, verifying relationships with a magic wand. But neither is state identification nor signed legal contracts. Wait till you find out that notarization, docusigned, NDA's or even wax seals are meant to be broken. Since we‚Äôre common we‚Äôre also inexpensive. Using dStaff is a cost of business, an incremental volume-based processing fee. We don‚Äôt participate in wage theft by requiring a percentage of yours (and their) finances. Eventually, we‚Äôll make it even easier for volume-based subscriptions but for now, pay as you go and don‚Äôt overpay. 

But, but Gas??
Oh and we‚Äôre batching transactions, in case you didn‚Äôt catch that above. This reduces overall gas fees, which we pay when we mint and send your dStaff NFTs. These are then bundled into single monthly invoices for easy payment (and accounting). 

And then‚Ä¶
Our primary goal is to simplify non-revenue driving aspects of owning your business. Once we‚Äôve helped you focus on work that you can (enjoy/love/ü§∑), we‚Äôre going to find other business workflows to automate for you. We know that the work you do is unique to you, as is creating a deal flow to maintain billables. We‚Äôre not going to disrupt these paramount aspects, instead, we‚Äôre going to empower you and the platforms you leverage with more simple workflows to keep you focused on work. And revenue. And build a reputation along the way.
